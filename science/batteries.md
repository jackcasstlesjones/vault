## Invented 1800AD (first chemical batteries that produced current)

- Metals have different affinities for electrons
- Put two metals in a conducting solution (acid, saltwater, even a potato) called an [[electrolyte]]
- The metal that wants more electrons will draw them from the other metal through the electrolyte solution, causing that metal (called a _terminal_) to become negatively charged
- The electrons gathering in the negatively charged terminal repel each other, so when a wire is connected between the two terminals, the electrons will 'escape' the crowd by running along the wire towards the positive end of the battery
