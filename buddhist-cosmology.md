# Buddhist Cosmology

Buddhist [[cosmology]] is the description of the shape description and evolution of the universe according to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries.

The spaial cosmology consists of a vertical cosmology, the various planes of beings, into which beings are reborn due to their merits and developments; and a horizontal cosmology, the distribution of these world-systems into an infinite sheet of existential dimensions included in the cycle of samsara.

The entre universe is said to be made up of five basic elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.

Some ages are filled with prosperity and peace due to common goodness, while others are filled with suffering, dishonesty and short lifespans.

## Geings can be reborn as _devas_ (gods and Brahmas), humans, animals, [[asuras]] (demons), [[pretas]] ("hungry ghosts") and as inhabitants of the hell realms.
