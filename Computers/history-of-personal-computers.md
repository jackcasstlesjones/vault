[[moc-computers]]

Effectively began in 1977 with the introduction of microcomputers.

Before this, computer terminals were used for time sharing access to central computers.

In 1977, the Apple II, Commodore PET 2001, and Tandy TRS-80 were released. They were the most popular computers by late 1978, and Byte magazine later referred to them as the "1977 Trinity".

In 1983 Apple released the first mass-marketed microcomputer with a graphical user interface (GUI), the Lisa. It came equipped with 1MB of RAM and a 5MB hard drive.

After the success of the Lisa, Apple released the Macintosh in 1984, with a now-famous Superbowl advert directed by [[ridley-scott|Ridley Scott]].
