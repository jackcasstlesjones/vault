# The Practice of Cutting Banknotes in Half for Secure Mailing

In the 18th and 19th centuries, sending money through the mail was a risky endeavor due to widespread highway robbery and mail theft. To mitigate this risk, individuals and businesses adopted a security measure: cutting banknotes in half and sending the two halves separately.

## How It Worked

1. Physical division – A banknote was cut in half, either horizontally or vertically.
2. Separate mailings – One half was sent first, and after confirmation of its arrival, the second half was mailed.
3. Reassembly and redemption – Upon receiving both halves, the recipient could tape or paste them back together and present the full note for use or exchange.

## Why It Was Effective

- If thieves intercepted one half, they couldn’t use or redeem the note without the other half.
- It reduced the chance of total loss—if one half went missing, the sender could sometimes request a reissue from the bank with proof of loss.

## Decline of the Practice

- Improved postal security – As mail services became more secure, with better tracking and protection, the need for splitting banknotes decreased.
- Advancements in banking – The rise of bank drafts, checks, and electronic transfers made mailing physical currency less necessary.
- Durability issues – Cutting notes made them fragile, and banks started implementing security features (like watermarks and signatures) that made such measures obsolete.
