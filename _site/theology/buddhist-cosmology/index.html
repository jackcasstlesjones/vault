<h1>Buddha ST Cosmology</h1>
<p>Buddhist [[cosmology]] is the description of the shape description and evolution of the universe according to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries.</p>
<p>The spatial cosmology consists of a vertical cosmology, the various planes of beings, into which beings are reborn due to their merits and developments; and a horizontal cosmology, the distribution of these world-systems into an infinite sheet of existential dimensions included in the cycle of samsara.</p>
<p>The entire universe is said to be made up of five basic elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.</p>
<p>Some ages are filled with prosperity and peace due to common goodness, while others are filled with suffering, dishonesty and short lifespans.</p>
<h2>Beings can be reborn as <em>devas</em> (gods and Brahmas), humans, animals, [[asuras]] (demons), [[pretas]] (&quot;hungry ghosts&quot;) and as inhabitants of the hell realms.</h2>
