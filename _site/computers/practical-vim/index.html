<h3>The Dot command</h3>
<ul>
<li>The dot command is the most powerful and versatile tool in the vim toolbox;</li>
<li>Vim records all keystrokes from the moment we enter Insert mode until we return to Normal mode.</li>
<li>Vim also records the method that we use to enter Insert mode, so if I press <code>A ;</code>to insert a semicolon at the end of a line, then after I press <code>j</code> to go down a line and then <code>.</code>, a semicolon will be immediately inserted at the end of the line, no matter where in that line I am.</li>
<li>The Dot Formula: Use one keystroke to move and one keystroke to execute.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find and replace</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>*</code> to instantly search for the word underneath the cursor.</li>
<li>When on a word, make a change (e.g. with <code>ciw</code>, then when you are on the next occurrence of the word, use <code>.</code> to change it instantly).</li>
</ul>
