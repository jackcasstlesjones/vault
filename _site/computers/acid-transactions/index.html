<p>ACID transactions are a set of rules that ensure database operations are performed correctly and reliably. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</p>
<p>How ACID transactions work</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity: Ensures that all transactions either succeed or fail completely. For example, when transferring money from one account to another, both actions must happen or neither happen.</li>
<li>Consistency: Ensures that data is stored accurately and consistently.</li>
<li>Isolation: Ensures that concurrent users don't interfere with each other.</li>
<li>Durability: Ensures that the database can recover to a previous state if there's a failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits of ACID transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>ACID transactions help ensure that data is valid and reliable, even if there are errors, power failures, or other issues. For example, if a transaction to transfer money fails, the database can roll back all changes and restore the database to its previous state.
Examples of ACID transactions</li>
<li>Creating a new record or updating data within a database are examples of ACID transactions.</li>
</ul>
