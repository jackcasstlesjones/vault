<h2>Invented 1800AD (first chemical batteries that produced current)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metals have different affinities for electrons</li>
<li>Put two metals in a conducting solution (acid, saltwater, even a potato) called an [[electrolyte]]</li>
<li>The metal that wants more electrons will draw them from the other metal through the electrolyte solution, causing that metal (called a <em>terminal</em>) to become negatively charged</li>
<li>The electrons gathering in the negatively charged terminal repel each other, so when a wire is connected between the two terminals, the electrons will 'escape' the crowd by running along the wire towards the positive end of the battery</li>
</ul>
