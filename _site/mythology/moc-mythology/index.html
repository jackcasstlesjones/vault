<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Odysseus inclines his head. &quot;True. But fame is a strange thing. Some men gain glory after they die, while others fade. What is admired in one generation is abhorred in another.&quot; He spread his broad hands. &quot;We cannot say who will survive the holocaust of memory. Who knows?&quot; He smiles. &quot;Perhaps one day even I will be famous. Perhaps more famous than you.&quot;&quot; - Madeline Miller</p>
