<h1>The Practice of Cutting Banknotes in Half for Secure Mailing</h1>
<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, sending money through the mail was a risky endeavor due to widespread highway robbery and mail theft. To mitigate this risk, individuals and businesses adopted a security measure: cutting banknotes in half and sending the two halves separately.</p>
<h2>How It Worked</h2>
<ol>
<li>Physical division – A banknote was cut in half, either horizontally or vertically.</li>
<li>Separate mailings – One half was sent first, and after confirmation of its arrival, the second half was mailed.</li>
<li>Reassembly and redemption – Upon receiving both halves, the recipient could tape or paste them back together and present the full note for use or exchange.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why It Was Effective</h2>
<ul>
<li>If thieves intercepted one half, they couldn’t use or redeem the note without the other half.</li>
<li>It reduced the chance of total loss—if one half went missing, the sender could sometimes request a reissue from the bank with proof of loss.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decline of the Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved postal security – As mail services became more secure, with better tracking and protection, the need for splitting banknotes decreased.</li>
<li>Advancements in banking – The rise of bank drafts, checks, and electronic transfers made mailing physical currency less necessary.</li>
<li>Durability issues – Cutting notes made them fragile, and banks started implementing security features (like watermarks and signatures) that made such measures obsolete.</li>
</ul>
