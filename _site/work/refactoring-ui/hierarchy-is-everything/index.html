<h1>hierarchy-is-everything</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use colour and weight to signifyu hierachy of text, not just size</li>
<li>Don’t go lighter than 400 font-weight\</li>
<li>Don’t use grey text on colour backgrounds. Instead, choose a colour with the same hue as the background, and adjust the brightness and saturation until it looks good.</li>
<li>De-emphasise competing elements, instead of over-emphasising the ‘selected’ or ‘important’ one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<ul>
<li>Labels are secondary. The data itself is what matters. The label is just there for clarity</li>
<li>Combine labels and values. Instead of in stock: 12, try something like 12 left in stock.</li>
<li>When using h1, h2 elements etc: Don't let the element you're using influence how you choose to style it - pick elements for semantic purposes and style them however you need, in order to create the best visual hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Balance weight and contrast</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lower the weight of an icon that is over-emphasised next to some text by lowering the contrast in relation to the background.</li>
<li>Use weight to compensate for contrast - if a thin border is too subtle using a soft colour, but using a darker colour makes it feel harsh and noisy, increase the weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Semantics are secondary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions. When designing these, it's important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.</li>
<li>When you take a hierarchy-first approach to designing the actions on page, the result is a much less busy UI that communicates more clearly.</li>
<li>Just because an action is destructive doesn't mean it has to be big, red, and bold.</li>
<li>If a destructive action isn't the primary action on the page, it could be better to give it secondary or tertiary button treatment.</li>
</ul>
